# Osmosis Spot-Only Fork Configuration Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the configuration changes and settings specific to the Osmosis Spot-Only Fork.

## Overview

The Osmosis Spot-Only Fork has been configured to:
- Remove all perpetuals and margin trading functionality
- Implement governance safeguards against future leverage modules
- Maintain all core DEX functionality (spot trading, AMM pools, liquidity provision)
- Provide a clean, secure trading environment focused on spot markets

## Configuration Files

### 1. Spot-Only Configuration (`config/spot-only-fork.toml`)

Primary configuration file for the spot-only fork:

```toml
[chain]
chain_id = "osmosis-spot-1"
chain_name = "Osmosis Spot-Only DEX"
description = "A spot-only decentralized exchange fork of Osmosis"

[governance-safeguards]
enabled = true
disable_leverage_modules = true
additional_restricted_types = ["perpetuals", "margin", "leverage", "futures", "derivatives"]

[trading]
spot_only = true
max_leverage = 0
margin_trading_enabled = false
perpetual_contracts_enabled = false
```

### 2. Application Configuration (`app/config.go`)

Updated to include spot-only and deployment configurations:

```go
type Config struct {
    GovernanceSafeguards config.GovernanceSafeguardsConfig `mapstructure:"governance-safeguards"`
    SpotOnly             config.SpotOnlyConfig             `mapstructure:"spot-only"`
    Deployment           config.DeploymentConfig           `mapstructure:"deployment"`
}
```

### 3. Spot-Only Module Configuration (`app/config/spot_only.go`)

Defines the spot-only configuration structure and validation:

- `SpotOnlyConfig`: Main configuration for spot-only mode
- `SpotOnlyGenesisConfig`: Genesis-specific settings
- `DeploymentConfig`: Deployment-specific settings
- Validation functions to ensure proper configuration

## Key Configuration Settings
