# Osmosis Leverage Audit - Summary of Findings

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive audit of the Osmosis v30 codebase for leverage-related functionality, **no perpetuals or margin trading modules were found**. The codebase appears to be focused on spot trading, automated market makers (AMM), and concentrated liquidity functionality.

## Key Findings

### 1. No Perpetuals Trading Module
- **Result**: No dedicated perpetuals trading functionality found
- **Evidence**: Only 1 reference to "perpetual" found, which relates to gauge types in the incentives system
- **Location**: `./app/upgrades/v20/upgrades.go` - refers to `PerpetualNumEpochsPaidOver` for incentive distribution

### 2. No Margin Trading Module
- **Result**: No margin trading functionality found
- **Evidence**: Only 2 references to "margin" found, both related to error margins in test files
- **Locations**: 
  - `./app/upgrades/v16/upgrades_test.go` - "Allow 0.01% margin of error"
  - `./app/upgrades/v17/upgrades_test.go` - "Allow 0.1% margin of error"

### 3. Position References Are Liquidity-Related
- **Result**: All "position" references relate to concentrated liquidity positions, not leveraged positions
- **Evidence**: 100+ references all relate to:
  - Concentrated liquidity pool positions (Uniswap V3 style)
  - Full-range liquidity positions
  - Position creation/withdrawal for AMM pools
  - Position IDs and liquidity management

### 4. No Leverage-Related Keywords Found
The following leverage-related terms returned **zero matches**:
- `leverage`
- `leveraged`
- `unrealized`
- `mark_price`
- `funding_rate`
- `maintenance_margin`
- `initial_margin`

### 5. Core DEX Modules Present
The audit confirmed the presence of legitimate spot trading modules:
- **concentrated-liquidity**: Concentrated liquidity pools (Uniswap V3 style)
- **cosmwasmpool**: CosmWasm-based custom pools
- **gamm**: Generalized Automated Market Maker pools
- **poolmanager**: Pool routing and management
- **protorev**: MEV protection and arbitrage
- **incentives**: Liquidity mining and rewards
- **superfluid**: Superfluid staking

### 6. No Leverage-Related Dependencies
- **go.mod analysis**: No leverage-related external dependencies found
- **Module structure**: No x/ modules related to perpetuals or margin trading

## Conclusion

The Osmosis v30 codebase is **clean of perpetuals and margin trading functionality**. All references to terms like "position" and "perpetual" are related to:

1. **Concentrated Liquidity Positions**: Standard AMM liquidity provision positions
2. **Incentive Gauges**: Reward distribution mechanisms (perpetual vs non-perpetual gauges)
3. **Test Error Margins**: Acceptable error ranges in unit tests

## Recommendations

1. **No Code Removal Required**: Since no leveraged trading functionality exists, no code removal is necessary
2. **Documentation Update**: Update project documentation to clearly state this is a spot-only DEX
3. **Governance Safeguards**: Consider implementing governance restrictions to prevent future addition of leverage modules
4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect any future attempts to add leveraged trading functionality

## Technical Details

- **Audit Method**: Comprehensive keyword search across entire codebase
- **Keywords Searched**: 18 leverage-related terms
- **Files Analyzed**: All .go files in the repository
- **Modules Reviewed**: All application modules and upgrade handlers
- **Dependencies Checked**: go.mod file for external leverage-related packages

## Files Generated

1. `audit_leverage.sh` - Automated audit script
2. `leverage_audit_results.md` - Detailed audit results (415 lines)
3. `audit_findings_summary.md` - This summary document

The audit confirms that Osmosis v30 is already a **spot-only DEX** without any leveraged trading capabilities.
