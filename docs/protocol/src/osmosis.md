# Introduction to Osmosis Spot-Only DEX

This is a spot-only fork of Osmosis, a fair-launched, customizable automated market maker for
interchain assets that allows the creation and management of
non-custodial, self-balancing, interchain token index similar to one of
Balancer.

**This fork focuses exclusively on spot trading and removes all leveraged trading capabilities.**

Inspired by [Balancer](http://balancer.finance/whitepaper) and Sunny
Aggarwal's '[DAOfying Uniswap Automated Market Maker
Pools](https://www.sunnya97.com/blog/daoifying-uniswap-automated-market-maker-pools)',
the goal for this Osmosis fork is to provide secure, simplified tools that extend
the use of AMMs within the Cosmos ecosystem for spot trading use cases. Bonding curves, while have found their primary use
case in decentralized exchange mechanisms, are utilized here specifically for
spot trading through the customizability that this fork offers.
Through features such as custom-curve AMMs,
dynamic adjustments of spread factors, and multi-token liquidity pools, this spot-only AMM
provides decentralized token swapping, liquidity provision, and yield farming
for the Cosmos ecosystem without the complexity and risks of leveraged trading.

Whereas most Cosmos zones have focused their incentive scheme on the
delegators, this Osmosis fork attempts to align the interests of multiple
stakeholders of the ecosystem such as LPs, DAO members, as well as
delegators. One mechanism that is introduced is how staked liquidity
providers have sovereign ownership over their pools, and through the
pool governance process allow them to adjust the parameters depending on
the pool's competition and market conditions. This spot-only fork is a sovereign
Cosmos zone that derives its sovereignty not only from its
application-specific blockchain architecture but also the collective
sovereignty of the LPs that have aligned interest to different tokens
that they are providing liquidity for, while maintaining focus on secure spot trading only.
